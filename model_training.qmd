Here are the scripts for the training the deepSSF model.

There is a script for training the deepSSF model using the derived covariates (NDVI, canopy cover, herbaceous vegetation and slope), and one for the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery + slope.

Both of these scripts are written in Python, and PyTorch is used for training the models.
